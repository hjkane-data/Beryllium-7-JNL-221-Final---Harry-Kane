				<p>Every year since 2009, New York State Department of Health environmental radiation surveillance testing conducted in Albany has revealed spikes in Beryllium-seven above the recommended healthy levels in picocuries. </p>

				<p>A picocurie is a fraction of the standard unit for radioactive material, the curie which measures how many particles of an isotope are present in aerosols. The recommended level for beryllium-7 is two-hundred and seventy picocuries per square meter , and tests in Albany have had levels as high as 960 picocuries per square meter. </p>

				<p>Beryllium-7 is an unstable isotope of the common metal beryllium that is naturally occurring. It stems from cosmic rays that reflect from the sun onto the Earth through the atmosphere. Being an isotope of beryllium it carries many of the same health risks as stable beryllium but they are mitigated due to the short half-life span of Beryllium-7, at just 53 days.</p>

				<p>According to the National Institute of Health, beryllium is toxic to humans posing a risk through both inhalation as well as physical contact with the skin. Beryllium causes an increased risk for lung cancer as well as chronic beryllium disease (CBD), an incurable, progressive lung disease, when inhaled. Contact with skin can lead to rashes, hives, which serve as a precursor to the aforementioned diseases in the lungs.</p>

				<p>The impact of beryllium exposure has caused the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to “set exposure limits at 0.2 g/m3 for an 8-hour time-weighted average.”</p>

				<p>As well as exposure limitations, employers are required to provide engineering controls and work practices to reduce exposure, respiratory and personal protective equipment (PPE), and implementation of medical surveillance and hazard communication programs.”</p>

				<p>These sorts of works sites that OSHA is regulating which use and distribute beryllium and its waste pose a hazard beyond the confines of the actual workplace. Environmental justice has sprung up in the last 40 years to track this exact issue.</p>

				<p>As Dr. Jennifer Flad, an associate professor in Syracuse University’s Sociology Department describes, the trend of greater presence of environmental toxins and pollutants has been seen in predominantly low-income and minority communities throughout the decades stemming from redlining.</p>

				<p>This trend observed by Flad prompts a question of whether or not the results in Albany’s testing fall in line with this pattern that can be seen across countless examples in the United States. Flad referenced in particular the lawsuit filed by residents within South Camden, New Jersey in 2001.</p>

				<p>South Camden Citizens in Action (SCCA) filed a suit alleging discriminatory permitting practices from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. The suit stemmed from issuing a permit to build a waste facility for the St. Lawrence Cement Co. to build in the waterfront neighborhood. South Camden at this point in time, was overly populated with these sort of waste facilities.</p>

				<p>While this has improved since the lawsuit, Camden is still home to nearly 10% of the state’s toxic waste facilities, and its residents are still disproportionately affected by respiratory disorders such as asthma, and lung cancer.</p>

				<p>In the case of Albany, the testing facility from which these results stem from sit in a previously redlined district. This area has been heavily industrialized as a direct result of the redlining that took place in Albany. Beryllium-7 seems to serve as the next potential environmental threat facing a low-income minority community in an American city.</p>

				<p>It is also important to mention that beryllium-7 rates can fluctuate from natural causes as well as human causes.</p>

				<p>As Jon French, one of Syracuse University’s chemistry professors describes “Beryllium-7 is typically made through reactions in the upper atmosphere…its like if you’ve racked a a set of pool balls and hit with it the cue ball…that is what is happening ”</p>

				<p>He is referring to beryllium-7’s forming in the process of cosmic spallation.</p>

				<p>Cosmic spallation is where heavier elements smash into each other and break apart the bonds that are formed at the time of impact. These protons and neutrons are then separated into lighter nucleotides such as beryllium or lithium.</p>

				<p>From here, these particles sit in the atmosphere waiting for deposition either through precipitation and wet deposition or dry deposition.</p>


				<p>Wet deposition is the most efficient method which uses precipitation to bring the beryllium-7 aerosols down to the earth’s surface starting its radioactive half-life cycle which is only about 53 days. However when there is a lack of this precipitation to facilitate wet deposition, beryllium-7 must undergo dry deposition.</p>

				<p>In this variation of deposition, there is no precipitation to force the aerosols to which the beryllium is attached. Thus, it's a combination of wind and gravity that moves the aerosols down to Earth where they either settle on surfaces such as rock or vegetation. Leaving Beryllium-7 in the air for longer</p>

				<p>While more data is needed to observe what the exact cause of these Beryllium-7 spikes are in Albany, residents must continue to be vigilant in examining their health with regards to air quality in the region.</p>
